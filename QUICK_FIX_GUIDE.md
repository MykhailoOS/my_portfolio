# Quick Fix Guide: CORS Error on InfinityFree

## üö® Are you seeing this error?

```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading 
the remote resource at https://errors.infinityfree.net/errors/404/. 
(Reason: CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing).
```

## ‚úÖ Solution: This has been fixed!

This repository now includes a complete fix for CORS issues on InfinityFree and similar free hosting providers.

## üì• Quick Steps to Apply the Fix

### 1. Update Your Files

Download or pull the latest version from this repository. The fix includes:

- ‚úì Updated `public/.htaccess`
- ‚úì Updated `public/api.php`
- ‚úì Updated `public/index.php`
- ‚úì Updated `lib/utils.php`
- ‚úì Updated `public/assets/js/app.js`

### 2. Upload to Your Server

**Important**: Make sure to upload ALL files, especially:
- `public/.htaccess` (this is critical!)
- All PHP files in `public/` and `lib/`
- JavaScript files in `public/assets/js/`

**FTP Users**: Upload `.htaccess` in **BINARY mode** (not ASCII)

### 3. Verify the Fix

Open this URL in your browser:
```
https://your-domain.com/test-cors.html
```

Click "Run All Tests" - all three tests should show **PASS** ‚úì

### 4. Test Your Application

1. Go to your Portfolio Builder: `https://your-domain.com/`
2. Try creating a new project
3. Expected: ‚úì Project creates without errors
4. Check browser console (F12) - no CORS errors should appear

## üîç Still Having Issues?

### Issue: Tests fail with "mod_headers not available"

**Solution**: Your hosting provider needs to enable Apache `mod_headers` module.

**For InfinityFree users**: 
- Contact support via their forum
- Request mod_headers to be enabled
- Usually enabled by default on newer servers

### Issue: .htaccess not working

**Check**:
1. Is the file named exactly `.htaccess` (with the dot)?
2. Is it in the `public/` directory (web root)?
3. Did you upload in binary mode via FTP?
4. Does your host support .htaccess files?

**For InfinityFree**: They support .htaccess by default

### Issue: Still getting 404 to infinityfree.net

**Solution**: Clear your browser cache completely:
- Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete ‚Üí Check "Cached images and files" ‚Üí Clear
- Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete ‚Üí Check "Cache" ‚Üí Clear
- Safari: Cmd+Option+E ‚Üí Empty Caches

Then refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

## üìö Detailed Documentation

For more information:

- **Full Fix Details**: See [CORS_FIX.md](CORS_FIX.md)
- **Testing Guide**: See [TEST_CHECKLIST.md](TEST_CHECKLIST.md)
- **Summary**: See [FIX_SUMMARY.md](FIX_SUMMARY.md)

## üéØ What Changed?

This fix adds CORS headers in three layers:

1. **Apache level** (.htaccess): Headers added to all responses
2. **PHP level** (api.php, utils.php): Headers in all API responses
3. **JavaScript level** (app.js): Better error handling and logging

This ensures CORS headers are always present, even if errors occur.

## üß™ Test Tools Included

### Test Page
Visit: `https://your-domain.com/test-cors.html`
- Interactive testing interface
- Three automated tests
- Clear pass/fail indicators
- Detailed response information

### API Test

## üí° Prevention Tips

To avoid CORS issues in the future:

1. Always upload `.htaccess` files when deploying
2. Test on staging environment first
3. Use the test tools after any deployment
4. Keep browser console open during testing
5. Clear cache when testing after changes

## üÜò Getting Help

If you've followed all steps and still have issues:

1. **Check your browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
   - Copy the EXACT error message
   - Note which file/URL is causing the error

2. **Run the CORS tests** and screenshot results

3. **Check server logs** if you have access

4. **Gather this information**:
   - Your hosting provider name
   - Browser and version
   - Operating system
   - Error messages (exact text)
   - Screenshots of test results
   - Network tab screenshots (F12 ‚Üí Network)

5. **Ask for help** with all the above information

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

You'll know the fix worked when:

- ‚úÖ No CORS errors in browser console
- ‚úÖ Project creation works smoothly
- ‚úÖ All three CORS tests pass
- ‚úÖ No redirects to infinityfree.net error pages
- ‚úÖ API requests return proper JSON responses
- ‚úÖ Application works as expected

## üîê Security Note

The current fix uses `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` which allows any domain to make requests to your API.

**For production use**, after confirming the fix works, consider:

1. Restricting CORS to your specific domain
2. Adding authentication
3. Using environment variables for configuration

See [CORS_FIX.md](CORS_FIX.md) for security hardening instructions.

## üì± Mobile Users

The fix works on mobile browsers too! Test on:
- Mobile Safari (iOS)
- Chrome Mobile (Android)
- Other mobile browsers

The test page is mobile-friendly.

## üéâ That's It!

After applying this fix:
1. Upload all files
2. Test with test-cors.html
3. Create a project
4. Start building!

The CORS issue should be completely resolved.
